## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Creating counter animations for displaying the number results.

```js
// display numbers
function displayNumbers() {
  // display years
  countingYears = setInterval(updateYears, 20);

  // display months
  countingMonths = setInterval(updateMonths, 20);

  // display days
  countingDays = setInterval(updateDays, 20);
}

// month counter
function updateMonths() {
  if (monthCounter === monthCalc) {
    clearInterval(countingMonths);
  }
  monthOut.innerText = monthCounter++;
}

// year counter
function updateYears() {
  if (yearCounter === yearCalc) {
    clearInterval(countingYears);
  }
  yearOut.innerText = yearCounter++;
}

// day counter
function updateDays() {
  if (dayCounter === dayCalc) {
    clearInterval(countingDays);
  }
  dayOut.innerText = dayCounter++;
}
```
